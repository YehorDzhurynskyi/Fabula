[Story]

A resident of the tundra rests in the mountains
and discovers that an avalanche moves on him,
he immediately begins his descent down

[Core Gameplay]

Using simple controls, it is necessary to get
away from the avalanche as far as possible,
on the way there are both obstacles (hurricanes,
stones, trees) and vehicles (licks, boats) that
will speed up the descent. The game has several
locations, such as: steep descent,
lake, forest area, glade - some of which
you need to go through the means of transport.
